[![Commenter-analyzer](https://github.com/gmag95/personalpage/blob/main/public/img/screenshots/commenter.png?raw=true)](https://commenter-application.herokuapp.com/comments)

Website that allows the users to post comments and read those uploaded by others with a frontend written in vanilla Javascript. The application includes full CRUD functionality and a login system.

An instance of Node.js, hosted on Digitalocean's web app platform, is used to manage the http requests while the comment and login data are stored in a MongoDB database hosted on MongoDB Atlas.
